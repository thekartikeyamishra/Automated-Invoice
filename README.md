# Automated-Invoice
For the next 15 days, I'll be creating and sharing 15 projects ‚Äì one per day! Free versions will be open to all on my GitHub, and a low-cost paid version will be available too. Can't wait to hear your thoughts!

Welcome to Automated Invoice Processing! This project is designed to help small businesses and MSMEs efficiently process invoices by extracting key information (e.g., invoice number, date, total amount) using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology.

### **Automated Invoice Processing: Basic Version**

Welcome to **Automated Invoice Processing**! This project is designed to help small businesses and MSMEs efficiently process invoices by extracting key information (e.g., invoice number, date, total amount) using **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** technology.

With this tool, you can:
1. Extract data from invoices (images or PDFs).
2. View the extracted information in a structured format.
3. Use a simple GUI for uploading invoices and managing results.

### **How It Works**

#### **1. Upload Invoices**
- Use the GUI to upload invoices as images or PDFs.
- The tool accepts common formats like `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.pdf`.

#### **2. Extract Data**
- The OCR engine processes the uploaded files and extracts text into a structured format.

#### **3. Save Extracted Data**
- Save the extracted text as `.json` files for further processing or integration.

#### **4. View Results**
- View extracted text directly within the GUI for a seamless experience.

### **Future Enhancements**

This project is a **basic version**, but here‚Äôs what‚Äôs planned for the future:
1. **Advanced Field Extraction**:
   - Extract specific fields such as invoice number, date, total amount, and more.
2. **Multi-Language OCR Support**:
   - Support for invoices in multiple languages.
3. **Integration with Bookkeeping Tools**:
   - Direct integration with platforms like QuickBooks or Zoho Books.
4. **Batch Processing**:
   - Handle multiple invoices simultaneously for faster processing.

### **Dependencies**

The project uses the following Python libraries:
- `pytesseract`: For OCR-based text extraction.
- `pdf2image`: To convert PDF pages into images.
- `opencv-python`: For image pre-processing.
- `Pillow`: For image handling in Python.

Install them with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
